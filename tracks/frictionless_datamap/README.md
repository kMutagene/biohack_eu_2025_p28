# Data validation in ARCs via frictionless

## Day 1

We identified datamaps in ARCs as a key interaction point for validating tabular data via frictionless. Frictionless uses its own schema to describe expected data formats, which should be able to be created from the datamap information.

## Day 2

Start of the work includes finding a suitable excel dataset on the DataHUB, for which the gitlab api will be queried.
